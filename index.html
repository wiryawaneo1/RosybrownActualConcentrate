      <p>The Sydney based organisation is <strong>currently not receiving any government funding.</strong> All of their staffs are currently volunteers.</p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
      <p>This section will contain two main information, <strong>research and user profile</strong>. Primary and secondary research will be conducted.</p>
      <p>The main purpose of <strong>primary research</strong> is to figure out the <em>current needs, issues and demographics</em> within ClothesLine or ones that are interested in contributing and will be conducted through questionnaires and interviews.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <strong>secondary research</strong> will focus on <em>existing data and materials around the general topic (Donation and Clothes)</em> that might not be directly connected to the organisation.</p>
      <p>Secondary research will be completed first before doing a primary research as secondary research will guide the proposal in a better direction when <strong>demographics, past activities and events and stakeholders has been analysed.</strong> With secondary research, <strong>research methods and questions</strong> will be easily identified for primary research.
      <h4 id="sResearch">Secondary Research</h4>
      <p><strong>Donations</strong></p>
      <p>In Australia, the amount of people and dollars donating to charities have been in a steady decline. Before 2018, even though the amount of people donating has decreased, the amount of dollars could still counterbalance it. However it has not been the case since 2018.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there has been a reduction in donations in Western Australia. From the <strong>biggest donors of 71% in 2015 to 57.2% donors in 2018.</strong> <cite>(Roy Morgan, 2018)</cite></p>
      <p>In summary, there is a steady decline in donation all over Australia. With <strong>66% of Australians donating in 2014 to 60% of Australians donating in 2019.</strong> <cite>(Roy Morgan, 2019)</cite></p>
      <p><strong>The Issue</strong></p>
      <p>However, in 2020, the numbers look different. Due to the pandemic that has been affected most of 2020, givers in Australia are more uncertain about giving. This is shown in "Australia Communities Forum" report that only <strong>16% of Australians</strong> believe that their donations to charities in the past few years has <strong>significantly/somewhat improved.</strong> <cite>(FPMagazine, 2020)</cite></p>
      <p>A survey held by FIA, More Strategic and Donor Republic,also predicts that <strong>fundraising revenue will drop by 20%</strong>. This is mainly because charities depends on live events and face to face events which has been put to a halt ever since the pandemic. <cite>(Shelly Dempsey, AICD, 2020)</cite></p>
      <p>Thus, the current pandemic are making the declining amoount of donations even worse.</p>
      <p><strong>Demographics</strong></p>
      <p>In terms of demographics and dollar donations, there are both positive and negative statistics.</p>
